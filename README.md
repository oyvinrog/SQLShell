- **🧠 Context-Aware Filtering** - Learns your search patterns and suggests relevant filters

### 💪 **Real-World Power**

| Use Case | Search Term | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Bug Hunting** | `"error"` | Find all error records across log tables |
| **Data Quality** | `"null"` | Spot missing data issues instantly |
| **Customer Analysis** | `"CUST_12345"` | Track customer across all tables |
| **Financial Auditing** | `"*.99"` | Find suspicious pricing patterns |

**The workflow**: Query → `Ctrl+F` → Type → **Instant insights** → `ESC` to return

This isn't just fast—it **changes how you think about data exploration**.

## 🤖 AI Features That Will Revolutionize Your Data Science

<div align="center">

**🧠 The First SQL Tool with Built-in Data Science AI 🧠**

*One-click insights that would take hours in traditional tools*

</div>

### 🔮 **One-Hot Encoding Magic**
Right-click any text column → **"Encode Text"** → **Instant ML-ready features**

```sql
-- Before: Messy categorical data
SELECT category FROM products;
-- "Electronics", "Books", "Clothing"...

-- After AI encoding (automatic):
SELECT 
    category_Electronics,
    category_Books,
    category_Clothing
FROM products_encoded;
-- Perfect binary features for machine learning!
```

**💡 Why this matters**: Transform any text column into ML-ready binary features in **seconds**, not hours.

### 📊 **Instant Correlation Analysis**
Right-click any column → **"Analyze Correlations"** → **See hidden relationships**

```sql
-- SQLShell's AI automatically generates:
SELECT 
    corr(price, rating) as price_rating_corr,
    corr(price, review_count) as price_reviews_corr,
    corr(rating, return_rate) as rating_returns_corr
FROM products;

-- Plus visual correlation matrix and insights!
```

**🚀 The game-changer**: Discover which variables drive your KPIs without writing correlation code.

### 🧠 **Multivariate Intelligence**
Select multiple columns → **"Deep Analysis"** → **AI reveals complex patterns**

- **Automatic feature importance ranking**
- **Interaction effect detection** 
- **Outlier identification with explanations**
- **Predictive relationship mapping**

### ⚡ **Real-World AI Power**

| Traditional Approach | SQLShell AI | Time Saved |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Write encoding scripts | Right-click → Encode | **Hours → 3 seconds** |
| Manual correlation analysis | AI correlation matrix | **30 min → 10 seconds** |
| Complex feature engineering | Automated suggestions | **Days → Minutes** |
| Exploratory data analysis | One-click insights | **Hours → Seconds** |

**The result**: You spend more time on insights, less time on data wrestling.
